I am a staff-level research engineer specializing in LLM post-training and distributed machine learning systems. My expertise spans scaling reinforcement learning algorithms, building high-performance distributed training and inference infrastructure, large scale human data collection, synthetic data generation, and research and development for various model capabilities.

I worked on [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) from its inception through 2.5 Pro. I'm now at [Microsoft AI](https://microsoft.ai/) helping to build an AI lab for Microsoft, where I combine deep technical execution with team building and technical leadership.

Originally from Newcastle, Australia, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my partner and two children.
