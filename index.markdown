I am a senior engineer and researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/), where I work on [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/). My current focus is on scaling reinforcement learning to accelerate reasoning research. Previously, I worked on sourcing high-quality human data and capabilities development for both Gemini and [Sparrow](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents/). Originally from Newcastle, Australia, I now live in the San Francisco Bay Area with my partner and two children.
